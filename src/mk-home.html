        Hey. I’m Michael – a college student and junior programmer from Northern New Jersey. I love to program, with my current languages
        being Java(EE), JavaScript (jQuery, Angular 1/2, Polymer), HTML(5), CSS(3), and SQL (SQLServer). I’m also super into
        hiking and photography.You can see some of my pictures (which include some of my hiking!) under the photos section,
        and all of my personal programming projects are on GitHub. Free free to contact me if you have any questions!
